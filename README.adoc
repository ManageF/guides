# Guides for ManageF



## Building

Clone this repository inside a GOPATH.
These instructions will use the example GOPATH of "$HOME/Projects/fm/core" but you can use whatever you want. Just change the first line of the below instructions to use your GOPATH.


[source,shell]
----
    
export GOPATH=$HOME/Projects/fm/core
mkdir -p $GOPATH
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p src/github.com/managef
cd src/github.com/managef
git clone git@github.com:managef/api
git clone git@github.com:managef/worker
git clone git@github.com:managef/models
export PATH=${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin

* Install Glide - the Go dependency management tool that ManageF uses to build itself

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/managef/api
make dep-install
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/managef/worker
